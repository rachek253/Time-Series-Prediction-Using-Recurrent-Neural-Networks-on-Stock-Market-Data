# DS 312 Final Project
## Time-Series-Prediction-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks-on-Stock-Market-Data

This repository provides a demonstration of retreiving historical stock market data from Kaggle, preprocessing it, and training and evaluating a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for stock price predictions.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 +
- pip packages:
     - glob
     - numpy
     - pandas
     - seaborn
     - matplotlib
     - scikit-learn
     - scipy.stats
     - tensorflow.keras
       
### Dataset
To use the Kaggle dataset, go to this link: 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumendraprasad/stock/data' and download the stock market data, or download the 'MAANG_Historical_Stock_Market_Data.csv' file in this repository.

### Jupyter Notebook
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file of the entire project.
